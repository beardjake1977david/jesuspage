    <p>Live By the fruit of the spirit with Love, 
        Joy, Peace, Patience, Kindness, Generosity, 
        Faithfulness, Gentleness and Self-control… 
        Those who are in Christ are distinguished 
        from unbelievers in that they have been gifted
         with the Holy Spirit, enabling them to bear 
         these fruits.</p>

      <h1>Christ Commanded Resolution </h1>
      <h2> Ecclesiastes 10:1-3 NIV
        10 As dead flies give perfume a bad smell,
            so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
        2 The heart of the wise inclines to the right,
            but the heart of the fool to the left.
        3 Even as fools walk along the road,
            they lack sense
            and show everyone how stupid they are. This is not Love.</h2>

<h1>Ministry and Evangelism</h1>
<h2>A divinely called and scripturally appointed and ordained ministry has been provided by our Lord for a two-fold purpose: (1) The evangelization of the world and (2) the edifying of the Body of Christ. ( Mark 16:15-20; Ephesians 4:11-13)</h2>

<h1>Religion</h1>
<H2> Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their tongues deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless. Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.</H2>

<h1>Man, His Fall, and Redemption</h1>
<h2>Man was created good and perfect; for God said: “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” But man, by voluntary transgression fell, and his only hope of redemption is in Jesus Christ. (Genesis 1:26-31; 3:1-17; Romans 5:12-21) </h2>
